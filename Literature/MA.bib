abstract = {The Bingham District is a large polymetallic mining district centered on an Eocene porphyry copper deposit 20 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Since its discovery in 1863 the district has at various times been a silver-lead, gold, lead-zinc-silver, and copper-gold-molybdenum district.The Bingham District is located in a zone of overlap between the Basin and Range extensional terrain and the Cordilleran fold and thrust belt. Permian quartzites and limestones were folded and thrust-faulted during several Mesozoic orogenies and then intruded by 39.8 to 37.5 Ma calcalkaline monzonite, quartz monzonite, and quartz latite. Volcanic breccias and flows petrochemically similar to the intrusions were erupted from centers close to the deposit from 39 to 33 Ma.The Bingham Porphyry Copper Deposit exhibits the concentric alteration and mineralization zoning characteristic of many porphyry deposits. However, the deposit is notable for the magnitude and intensity of the various kinds of mineralization present:It is one of the largest copper deposits in the world with pre-mining reserves of almost 3 billion tons of 0.67 percent copper ore.Nested within the copper orebody are overlapping zones of molybdenum, gold, and silver mineralization that mimic the shape of the copper deposit and contain greater than 0.1 percent MoS2, 0.01 ounces per ton gold, and 0.5 ounces per ton silver respectively.Major copper-gold skarn deposits flank the copper orebody on two sides. They include the Carr Fork Deposit (61 million tons of 1.90 percent copper, 0.01 ounces per ton gold, and 0.31 ounces per ton silver) and the North Ore Shoot Deposit (82 million tons of 2.81 percent copper, 0.05 ounces per ton gold, and 1.57 ounces per ton silver).Vein and replacement lead-zinc-silver deposits located in a halo around the porphyry and skarn deposits have produced 28 million tons at an average grade of 8.6 percent lead, 6.6 percent zinc, 5.0 ounces per ton silver, and 0.039 ounces per ton gold.The Barneys Canyon and Melco Deposits located five miles north of the porphyry copper deposit have combined pre-mining reserves of 19 million tons at a grade of 0.05 ounces per ton gold. They are sediment-hosted gold deposits characterized by sub-micron sized disseminated gold mineralization, an arsenic-antimony-barium-mercury-thallium geochemical signature, low silver and base metal contents, and an almost complete absence of quartz veining. The deposits lie at the outer edge of an extensive arsenic-gold geochemical halo about the Bingham Porphyry Copper Deposit, but chronological and genetic relationships to the porphyry deposit have not been clearly established.},

abstract = {In this study we used LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry) to determine U-Pb ages of 5 zircon samples of known age (∼1800 Ma to ∼50 Ma) in order to determine the reproducibility, precision, and accuracy of this geochronologic technique. This work was performed using a ThermoFinnigan Element2 magnetic sector double-focusing ICP-MS coupled with a New Wave Research UP-213 laser system. The laser ablation pit sizes ranged from 30 to 40 $\mu$m in diameter. Laser-induced time-dependent fractionation is corrected by normalizing measured ratios in both standards and samples to the beginning of the analysis using the intercept method. Static fractionation, including those caused during laser ablation and due to instrumental discrimination, is corrected using external zircon standards. Total uncertainty for each laser analysis of an unknown is combined quadratically from the uncertainty in the measured isotope ratios of the unknown and the uncertainty in the fractionation factors calculated from the measurement of standards. For individual analyses we estimate that the accuracy and precision are better than 4{\%} at the 2 sigma level, with the largest contribution in uncertainty from the measurement of the standards. Accuracy of age determinations in this study is on the order of 1{\%} on the basis of comparing the weighted average of the LA-ICP-MS determinations to the TIMS ages. Due to unresolved contributions to uncertainty from the lack of a common Pb correction and from potential matrix effects between standards and unknowns, however, this estimate cannot be universally applied to all unknowns. Nevertheless, the results of this study provide an example of the type of precision and accuracy that may be possible with this technique under ideal conditions. In summary, the laser ablation technique, using a magnetic sector ICP-MS, can be used for the U-Pb dating of zircons with a wide range of ages and is a useful complement to the established TIMS and SHRIMP techniques. This technique is especially well suited to reconnaissance geochronologic and detrital zircon studies.},

The molybdenite ages all overlap at the 2$\sigma$ level. Previous investigations have suggested that mineralization at Bingham Canyon is coincident with and genetically related to the emplacement of the Bingham stock within the Bingham intrusive complex. However, the molybdenite ages are younger than all reported ages for magmatism in the Bingham porphyry deposit ({\~{}}39.8 to 37.6 Ma). This suggests either that all the reported ages of the Bingham intrusions are disturbed and the actual ages of the intrusive rocks are younger or that molybdenite mineralization is not directly related to emplacement and cooling of any dated intrusion exposed at Bingham. The latter scenario would suggest the Bingham stock is just the focal point for the superposition of exsolved fluids from deeper in the system.},

Extrapolation of the basal contact of the 39 Ma volcanic rocks shows that they likely covered parts of the Bingham intrusions less than 500 m above the pre-mining surface. Some Bingham intrusions may have vented to the surface to help form the volcanic sequence. Minette and shoshonite lavas occur in subordinate amounts within the volcanic sequence. Minette dikes (37.74 ±0.11 Ma) in the Bingham Canyon ore body are the same age as late mineralized porphyry dikes (37.72 ± 0.09 Ma) and unaltered minette flows (37.82 ± 0.14 Ma). These ages confirm that minette magma may have played a role in the petrogenesis of ore-related intrusions in the Bingham mining district.},

abstract = {The Melco deposit is the largest of five gold mines that constitute the 1.5 million ounces Barneys Canyon project. The deposits form an arc along the nose of the north-trending Copperton anticline. Gold mineralization formed in structurally prepared zones near Theologically contrasting formational contacts. Bedding plane slip during Mesozoic folding caused some deformation. The Melco deposit, located on the NW flank of the Copperton anticline, was localized in a structurally complex zone at the intersection of a N 55° E-trending strain corridor and N 30° E-striking high-angle faults. The latter faults provided conduits for Tertiary-age gold-bearing fluids and late stage carbon-pyrite-orpiment-realgar introduction. In cross section, gold distributions resemble an upright goblet with a stem but no base.These sediment-hosted deposits contain micron-sized gold as native metal and as inclusions within the arsenic-rich rims of zoned pyrite grains. The deposits are anomalous in As-Sb-Tl-Hg, and contain low silver and base metal values. Bleaching and decalcification are the most pronounced alteration effects. Silicification is present but subtle. The deposits lie at the outer edge of an asymmetrical pyrite-Au-As halo developed around the Bingham Canyon porphyry system. There is a growing body of evidence that these sediment-hosted gold deposits represent a distal precious metal event genetically related to late stage mineralization at Bingham Canyon, which lies 5 miles to the south.},

abstract = {Copper-gold skarns peripheral to the porphyry copper deposit in the Bingham mining district, Utah, contain a geologic resource of over 7 million tons of copper and 9 million ounces of gold. The skarn deposits, hosted by Pennsylvanian limestone beds within the contact metamorphic aureole of the Tertiary Bingham stock, have been mined intermittently since 1896. In the late 1960s, two large deposits were discovered at depth on the north side of the district by The Anaconda Company and Kennecott Copper Corporation: the Carr Fork mine, operated by Anaconda from 1979 to 1981, and the North Ore Shoot deposit, which has not entered production. Recent drilling by Kennecott on the eastern flank of the North Ore Shoot has resulted in discovery of the Fortuna deposit. These three areas are all part of the same, continuous skarn system.A remarkable horizontal and vertical extent of skarn is displayed within the Bingham district. Mineralized skarn occurs in a zone roughly 2,000 feet wide around the quartz monzonite porphyry phase of the Bingham stock and extends over a mile vertically from surface exposures to the deepest drill-hole intersection. Skarn ore, delineated by the +1 percent copper grade contour, lies outside the porphyry copper ore shell and extends to a lower elevation. The Carr Fork orebodies consist predominantly of chalcopyrite in retrograde-altered garnetite skarn. In the North Ore Shoot and Fortuna deposits, massive sulfide replacement bodies are the principal ore type, although mineralized garnetite is also present. Pyrite-gold mineralization that crosscuts copper-gold skarn has been found in the Bingham skarn deposits, but its relationship to other gold mineralization in the district is unclear. Beyond the zone of copper-iron-gold mineralization, lead-zinc-silver deposits occur in limestone and other host rocks within a broad halo nearly one mile wide.},

@article{Jowitt2013,
abstract = {A single mining camp or ore deposit can contain multiple mineral deposit types but may have mineral reserves or resources classified by what a mining or mineral exploration company considers to be the dominant mineralization type in the area. In this paper, we summarize recent work on the challenges of reporting mineral deposits by geologic processes rather than by grades, tonnages, and mineral processing approaches. For example, the Ertsberg-Grasberg district of Indonesia contains several large skarn Cu-Au-Ag deposits, with the discovery outcrop as well as early production entirely in skarn. All early publications and resource descriptions refer to it as the Ertsberg district. Subsequent discovery of the giant Grasberg porphyry Cu-Au-Ag deposit led to the entire district being renamed Grasberg and classified as a porphyry deposit, despite the skarn-focused discovery and early production history of the deposit, as well as the presence of several large skarn deposits within the district. The Ok Tedi Cu-Au-Ag deposit of western Papua New Guinea also is generally thought of as a major porphyry Cu deposit, yet hosts both porphyry and skarn mineralization. Current reserve estimates indicate that the majority of the contained metal within the deposit is hosted by skarns rather than porphyry bodies. Thus, following the Grasberg example in terms of contained metal, Ok Tedi could be classified as a skarn rather than a porphyry deposit. In addition, comparatively minor mineral deposits can prove useful during exploration; this is exemplified by the large Au-Cu-Ag porphyry deposits at Cadia in Australia that were discovered by exploring modest skarn deposits using the Ertsberg-Grasberg skarn-porphyry model. Here, we extend a recent global compilation of economic Cu mineral resources by analyzing cumulative production and reserve-resource data for Ertsberg-Grasberg, Ok Tedi, and Cadia, and provide a brief review of a number of other Cu projects that contain multiple mineralization types. Overall, in order to help inform exploration strategies as well as facilitate the development of more comprehensive and accurate mineral deposit models, there is clearly positive value for the mineral exploration and mining industry in reporting ore reserves and mineral resources by mineralization type.},

The production of high-grade copper-gold ore started in 1897. Utah Copper became the first flourishing low-grade porphyry copper operation in 1904, using block caving, but switched to large-scale open pit methods a couple years later.Bingham is one of the most productive mining districts the world. The district is zoned outward from porphyry Cu-Mo-Au through Cu-Au skarn, pyrite halo, Pb-Zn-Ag vein and replacement deposits to distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au ores. District metal production includes over 2.8 billion tons of porphyry ore, averaging approximately 0.7{\%} Cu, 0.05{\%} Mo, 0.4 ppm Au, and 3 ppm Ag; 32.8 million tons of lead-zinc-silver ores with recovered grades of 7{\%} Pb, 3{\%} Zn, 125 ppm Ag, and 1 ppm Au; and an additional 30.6 million tons of 2.1 ppm Au in sedimentary rock-hosted gold ores.

abstract = {Tertiary intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and Upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks were sampled at 47 sites in the Oquirrh Mountains. Paleomagnetic data from over 350 samples provide a grand mean direction for the Oquirrh Mountains derived from site means determined by averaging best-fit lines. The grand mean for the Oquirrh Mountains (D/I = 332.1/55.4, $\alpha$95 = 4.1) compared with a late Eocene reference direction (D/I = 351.2/58.3, $\alpha$95 = 2.4) provides a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of deformation related to extension. The discrepancy between the observed and expected late Eocene directions is interpreted to indicate that the Oquirrh Mountains have been tilted some 10.8 ± 4.0 degrees, down to the east, since late Eocene time. This contrasts with previous estimates of about 15 to 25 degrees of tilting based on orientations of volcaniclastic strata and the apparent asymmetry of the Bingham Canyon porphyry copper ore shell. A modest amount of tilt is consistent with a subhorizontal decoupling or anastomosing shear zone model for extension in the eastern Great Basin. Seismic reflection profiles, two-dimensional basin modeling using residual gravity profiles, and earthquake focal mechanisms corroborate this conclusion.},

abstract = {Three chemical profiles, based on 31 analyses of intrusive igneous rocks, are used to characterize the relations of chemical changes to alteration mineralogy at Bingham, Utah. The chemical trends are reasonably coherent along the profiles, indicating a large-scale uniformity of alteration. Average compositions show cumulative effects of successive biotitic and sericitic alterations (slight loss of A1, substantial loss of Ca q-Na, increase in Na: Ca ratios) that are similar in most respects to many porphyry copper deposits. Biotitic alteration of quartz monzonite occurred with only small gains in K; losses of Mg and ferrous iron were also small. The replacement of clinopyroxene and amphibole by hydrothermal biotite represents a high-temperature hydrolysis reaction in which K and Mg are largely recombined rather than lost from the system. A chemically and mineralogically distinct, northeast-trending zone of sericitic altera- tion was superimposed upon biotitized host rocks in the northern half of the orebody. This hydrolyric alteration occurred under conditions near the stability boundary between K-feldspar and sericite but on the mica side of the sericite-plagioclase boundary. Sulfide mineralization and alteration •vere integral parts of a multistage hydrothermal history confined to a broad zone of repeatedly fractured host rocks.},

abstract = {Phyllic and argillic alteration at Bingham consists of smectite, sericite, and kaolinite. X-ray diffraction and microprobe studies show that sericite in these alteration assemblages is illite interstratified with 10 percent or less smectite. Illite occurs as a replacement of plagioclase phenocrysts, in veins, and as pervasive disseminations in the rock along with smectite and minor kaolinite. The illite/smectite interstratification is a mixture of 1M and 2M polytypes and generally contains more smectite in the finer size fractions. Structural formulae for the illite show less K and Al and more Si than muscovite. The illites also contain octahedral Mg and an octahedral layer charge. The Kubler crystallinity index increases systematically as particle size decreases.Smectite dominates in pervasive alteration of whole rock, plagioclase phenocrysts, and one vein. Illite is the major constituent of vein clays. The smectite replacing plagioclase and whole rock is montmorillonite and smectite in the vein is beidellite. The distribution of smectite, illite, and kaolinite at present mining levels appears to be different than reported in earlier studies in that smectite may be a major component of phyllic and argillic alteration while kaolinite is a minor component. Sample traverses on pit benches through the quartz monzonite porphyry show no systematic variations in mineral abundances.Measurements of clay alteration of phenocrysts in quartz monzonite porphyry in drill hole 50 from an elevation of 5,730 to 3,260 feet show an increase in smectite content downward to the core of the quartz monzonite porphyry, just below present mining levels, and then a decrease to minimum values near the lower contact with monzonite. Copper grades decrease systematically throughout this interval. This pattern of smectite distribution is not observed in horizontal traverses on bench levels across the quartz monzonite porphyry.40Ar/39Ar age spectrum analysis on a hydrothermal biotite from altered quartz monzonite porphyry yields an isochron age of 37.07 ± 0.21 Ma. Sericite and K-feldspar phenocrysts from this sample also yield apparent ages of {\~{}}37 Ma, but have complex age spectra. The apparent age concordance for these three minerals suggests a hydrothermal event in the quartz monzonite porphyry that produced biotite and sericite at indistinguishable times and may have partially reset the K-feldspar. In comparison, an isochron age for a 10 to 20 mm split of vein sericite in monzonite from the present pit bottom is 37.81 ± 0.20 Ma, whereas a maximum age of a vein sericite in monzonite from the 6440 level is 39.71 ± 0.34 Ma. Coupled with the results of Moore and Lanphere (1971) and the Warnaars et al. (1978) data compilation, these new results allow for a minimum duration of {\~{}}1 Ma for the hydrothermal activity at Bingham.},

abstract = {The Bingham Canyon porphyry copper deposit has been a world class producer of copper and other metals since 1904. Sulfide mineral distribution is typical of many porphyry copper deposits, with an outer, low-grade zone of pyrite and chalcopyrite and an inner zone of chalcopyrite. Molybdenite occurs in the center of the deposit. A late bornite-gold episode overprints part of the earlier mineralization. The deposit occurs principally within the composite Bingham stock, consisting of an equigranular monzonite phase that is intruded by a wide, dike-like body of quartz monzonite porphyry and younger latite porphyry and quartz latite porphyry dikes.Propylitic, potassic, and phyllic alteration are recognized. Pervasive actinolite-chlorite alteration in the monzonite phase of the Bingham stock was followed by biotite veinlets, with little associated sulfide mineralization, which fill crackle fractures in the monzonite. These veinlets are crosscut by quartz-biotite veins containing chalcopyrite with strong biotite and K-feldspar selvages. As the veins evolve to more planar, continuous stockworks, chalcopyrite becomes more abundant and then decreases as molybdenite appears. Quartz-molybdenite veins contain minor chalcopyrite and weak biotite. The zone of {\textgreater}0.7 percent copper forms an annulus in which copper grades locally exceed 1.0 percent within at least four distinct pods. One of these high-grade areas, located in the southwestern part of the deposit, may represent a separate center of mineralization. Gold grades of four to five times the average in the copper orebody occur within the gold-bornite zone ({\textgreater}0.02 oz/t Au) on the north side of the deposit, where blast hole assays of up to 0.1 oz/t gold are not uncommon. Bornite mineralization is associated with a set of quartz-K-feldspar veins with selvages of K-feldspar/silica flooding and perhaps clay/sericite alteration. This gold-bornite zone appears to overprint earlier chalcopyrite mineralization, and may be a variant of potassic alteration. Phyllic alteration consists of quartz-sericite-pyrite veins, mainly in a zone peripheral to the orebody. In the higher-grade copper zone, veins are found that are similar to quartz-sericite-pyrite veins except that the predominant or only sulfide is chalcopyrite.},

abstract = {The Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposit is located in the central part of the Oquirrh Mountains, 30 km southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. The Cu-Au-Mo deposit lies at the center of a large polymetallic district, which includes proximal Pb-Zn-Ag replacement and distal sediment-hosted gold mineralization. Open-pit copper mining commenced in 1906 and through 2011 has produced 2.666 billion tonnes of ore averaging 0.74{\%} Cu, 0.035{\%} Mo, 0.448 g/t Au, and 3.29 g/t Ag. Bingham lies near the west end of an 80-km-long belt of petrochemically similar Eocene to Oligocene intrusions and coeval volcanic rocks, which host base and precious mining districts. The Bingham district is centered on the Bingham stock, a multiphase mid-Eocene intrusion emplaced into a thick succession of folded mid- to upper Paleozoic siliciclastic and carbonate rocks. The 2 × 2 km Bingham stock consists mainly of premineral equigranular monzonite that was intruded successively by a 2-km-long dike-like body of quartz monzonite porphyry (QMP), long narrow dikes and sills of intramineral latite porphyry (LP), and narrower dikes of late-mineral quartz latite porphyry (QLP). The intrusions and associated porphyry-style mineralization dip steeply to the northwest and persist from the pre-mine surface at 2,390 m to below sea level. U-Pb zircon dating indicates a 38.6 Ma age for the equigranular monzonite and suggests that the subsequent porphyry intrusions were emplaced at ∼ 38 Ma. Porphyry intrusion and mineralization were approximately synchronous. Early actinolite-stable alteration in igneous and sedimentary rocks is flanked by distal chlorite-epidote alteration. Magnetite-destructive secondary biotite alteration is pervasive in intrusive rocks that contain {\textgreater} 0.7{\%} copper but typically is fracture-controlled and overprints earlier actinolite alteration in lower grade intrusive rocks and quartzites. K-feldspar alteration accompanies the highest grade copper and gold mineralization. Sericitic alteration is locally pervasive but, more typically, it is restricted to the margins of late quartz-pyrite veins. Late, low-temperature montmorillonite ± kaolinite alteration is ubiquitous in the intramineral porphyries and adjacent equigranular monzonite. An outer zone of 0.35 to {\textgreater} 0.70{\%} Cu mineralization surrounds and overlaps an inner zone of 0.05 to {\textgreater} 0.15{\%} Mo mineralization, which in turn forms a cupola around a barren core. Intense bornite-chalcopyrite-chalcocite-gold mineralization ({\textgreater} 0.7{\%} Cu and {\textgreater} 1 g/t Au) occurred directly above the barren core but has largely been removed by mining. The copper mineralization in the flanks of the deposit is dominated by chalcopyrite. Copper and gold grades decrease downward but quartz-molybdenite stockwork mineralization grading {\textgreater} 0.05{\%} Mo extends to the lower limit of drilling. Equigranular monzonite is the predominant ore host, containing 53{\%} of the ore mined to date. Vein types proceed in a sequence from early biotite through quartz-sulfide to late anhydrite and zeolite. Early copper-bearing quartz veins are truncated by the LP and QLP dikes, but later copper-bearing veins cut the dikes. Cathode luminescence studies indicate that copper-bearing sulfides were deposited within micro-fractures and vugs created by dissolution of earlier quartz. Quartz-molybdenite veins postdate the copper-bearing veins and cut all of the porphyries. Vein densities reach {\textgreater} 10 vol {\%} in the barren core and decrease to ∼ 1 vol {\%} at the outer boundary of the {\textgreater} 0.35{\%} Cu zone. Published fluid inclusion and vein density studies, together with modeled grade distributions, show that mineralization was precipitated by a plume of metal-bearing fluid approximately 2 km in diameter, centered near the southeastern edge of the QMP. The barren core apparently represents an upflow zone near the top of which supercritical fluids separated into vapor and brine. Copper-bearing sulfides and gold precipitated as vapor-dominant fluids cooled from 430° to 350°C. Inclusions in quartz from the deep flanks of the copper deposit indicate similar fluid compositions, but less separation into vapor and brine.},

abstract = {Quartz veins in porphyry copper deposits record the physiochemical evolution of fluids in subvolcanic magmatic-hydrothermal systems. We have combined cathodoluminescence (CL) petrography with fluid-inclusion microthermometry to unravel the growth history of individual quartz veins and to link this history to copper ore formation at Bingham, Utah. Early barren quartz veins with K-feldspar+biotite (potassic) alteration selvages occur throughout the 2 km vertical exposure of quartz monzonite porphyry stock. At depths of 500 m to at least 1350 m below the orebody, fluid inclusions in these barren veins trapped a single-phase CO (sub 2) -bearing fluid containing approximately 2-12 wt{\%} NaCl (sub equiv) . Within and to depths of 500 m below the orebody, early quartz veins contain abundant hypersaline liquid (38-50 wt{\%} NaCl (sub equiv) ) and vapor-rich inclusions trapped together at temperatures of 560-350 degrees C and pressures of 550-140 bar, consistent with fluctuations between lithostatic and hydrostatic pressure at paleodepths of 1.4 to 2.1 km. CL petrography shows that bornite and chalcopyrite were deposited together with a later generation of quartz and K-feldspar in microscopic fractures and dissolution vugs in early barren quartz veins and wall rock. This late quartz contains hypersaline liquid (36-46 wt{\%} NaCl (sub equiv) ) and vapor-rich inclusions trapped at 380-330 degrees C and at 160-120 bar hydrostatic pressure. We conclude that a single-phase magmatic-hydrothermal fluid underwent phase separation to hypersaline liquid (or brine) and vapor approximately 500 m below the base of the orebody at a paleodepth of approximately 2.5 km. Brine and vapor continued to ascend and formed multiple generations of barren quartz veins with potassic selvages. Thermal decline to temperatures below 400 degrees C was the main driving force for copper-iron sulfide deposition, given the lack of evidence of mixing of brines with low-salinity waters, the lack of correspondence of the ore zone with the initiation of phase separation, and no change in wall-rock alteration style.},

abstract = {Increased precision in isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) U-Pb geochronology has revealed age complexities in zircon populations that require new tools for understanding how the growth of zircon is related to geologic processes. U and Pb are routinely separated from other elements in dated minerals by ion exchange separation prior to TIMS isotope measurement. We develop a method in which trace elements in the exact same volume of zircon are redissolved and analyzed using solution nebulization inductively coupled plasma sector-field mass spectrometry with matrix-matched external liquid calibration. Using {\textless}0.5. ml solution, resulting concentrations are between {\textless}1. ppt for elements such as Ti, Nb and Ta and tens of ppb for Zr. By analyzing a series of standard solutions, zircons and procedural blanks, we show that accurate measurements are performed on Zr, Hf, Y, Sc, and the HREE while low-concentration elements can be measured accurately to {\textless}5. ppt. We performed combined U-Pb ID-TIMS geochronology with trace element analysis (here called U-Pb TIMS-TEA) on zircons from eight volcanic rocks comprising several volcanic systems and one metamorphic sample. Similar to previous in situ trace element analyses, zircon geochemistry is distinct between different samples and records petrogenetic processes such as fractional crystallization, assimilation and/or magma mixing. Unique from in situ analysis, U-Pb TIMS-TEA can trace geochemical evolution in accessory minerals with adequate age precision to resolve magmatic processes in rocks at least 200 million years old. This provides a means to identify auto-, ante- and xenocrystic zircon and lead to more robust age interpretations in ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronology. One suite of Cretaceous andesitic zircons shows correlations in geochemistry and absolute time that record evolution of a magmatic system over {\~{}}250 ka prior to eruption. Future work will combine U-Pb TIMS-TEA with solution isotopic analysis of Nd, Sr and Hf and will be applied to a host of datable minerals such as monazite, sphene, apatite, rutile, xenotime, and baddeleyite. These combined tools will provide access to an improved understanding of a wide range of igneous and metamorphic processes as a function of time. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Thermal ionization mass spectrometers, or TIMS, were developed by the pioneers of mass spectrometry in the mid-20th century, and have since been workhorses for generating isotopic data for a wide range of elements. Later-developed mass spectrometric techniques have many advantages over TIMS, including higher spatial resolution with in situ techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), and greater versatility in terms the elements that can be easily-and well-measured. The reason TIMS persists as an important method for geochronology is that for some key parent-daughter systems (e.g., U–Pb, Sm–Nd), it can produce isotopic data and resultant dates with 10–100 times higher precision and more quantifiable accuracy than in situ techniques, even when sample sizes are very small (such as those that might result from single crystals, or even small portions of zoned crystals). For many questions in the geosciences, the highest achievable precision and accuracy are required to resolve the timescales of processes and/or correlate events globally. As an example, modern TIMS U–Pb geochronology is capable of producing dates with precision and accuracy better than 0.1{\%} of the age for single crystals with only a few picograms (pg) of Pb. Therefore, it is possible to constrain the durations of single zircon crystal growth in magmatic systems over tens to hundreds of kyr in Mesozoic and younger rocks. If these dates and rates can be connected with other igneous processes such as magma transfer, emplacement and crystallization, then it becomes possible to calibrate thermal and mass budgets in magmatic systems and evaluate competing models for pluton assembly and subvolcanic magma storage. As another example, Sm–Nd geochronology of garnet permits dates with precision better than ±1 million years for garnets of any age, including multiple concentric growth zones in single crystals.

abstract = {This study presents a new laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) based U-Pb geochronometric method for dating grossular-andradite (grandite) garnet. Grandite is a primary skarn mineral, therefore dating its growth directly dates hydrothermal activity. As zircon U-Pb geochronometry provides a high-resolution record of magmatic processes, grandite U-Pb dating has the potential to provide a complementary record for hydrothermal systems. This study characterizes four garnets of variable grossular-andradite content and age as potential reference materials for LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronology: Willsboro Andradite ({\~{}} 1020 Ma, Adirondacks, USA), Red and Yellow Mali Grandite ({\~{}} 200 Ma, Southern Mali) and Lake Jaco Grossular ({\~{}} 35 Ma, Coahuila, Mexico). Isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) U-Pb analyses of Willsboro andradite yield a mean206Pb/238U date of 1022 ± 16 Ma. We use Willsboro Andradite as a primary reference material for LA-ICPMS U-Pb characterization of the two other garnets. The non-radiogenic Pb (Pbc) concentration in grandite is variable between specimens. Willsboro Andradite and Mali Grandites contain almost purely radiogenic Pb (Pb*), however Lake Jaco Grossular has a higher Pbc concentration comparatively and yields discordant U/Pb ratios. For specimens with highly variable Pb*/Pbc, linear regression is employed to derive a lower-intercept age. LA-ICPMS U-Pb dates for Yellow Mali Grandite (202 ± 2 Ma;206Pb/238U weighted mean) and Lake Jaco Grossular (35 ± 2 Ma; lower intercept) agree with independent ID-TIMS U-Pb (202.0 ± 1.2 Ma) and (U-Th)/He dates (35 ± 5 Ma) derived for each specimen. The precision of LA-ICPMS U-Pb dates varies between 1–10{\%} (2{\$}\sigma{\$}) for the analyzed garnets. Considering the short estimated lifespans of pluton-related hydrothermal systems (tens of thousands to a few million years), Neogene skarns present the best opportunity to test for and resolve separate episodes of garnet growth at these precision levels. As a performance test for the method, we present new U-Pb andradite data from a Late Miocene skarn system on Serifos Island, Greece. This garnet yields a lower-intercept age of 9.15 ± 0.36 Ma, in agreement with biotite Rb-Sr and zircon U-Pb dates from the causative pluton.},

abstract = {Porphyry Cu systems host some of the most widely distributed mineralization types at convergent plate boundaries, including porphyry deposits centered on intrusions; skarn, carbonate-replacement, and sediment-hosted Au deposits in increasingly peripheral locations; and superjacent high- and intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits. The systems commonly define linear belts, some many hundreds of kilometers long, as well as occurring less commonly in apparent isolation. The systems are closely related to underlying composite plutons, at paleodepths of 5 to 15 km, which represent the supply chambers for the magmas and fluids that formed the vertically elongate ({\textgreater}3 km) stocks or dike swarms and associated mineralization. The plutons may erupt volcanic rocks, but generally prior to initiation of the systems. Commonly, several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones, resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry Cu systems. The rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size, grade, and type of mineralization generated in porphyry Cu systems. Individual systems have life spans of {\~{}}100,000 to several million years, whereas deposit clusters or alignments as well as entire belts may remain active for 10 m.y. or longer.The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems, occupying many cubic kilometers of rock, are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms, which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions. Porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits are centered on the intrusions, whereas carbonate wall rocks commonly host proximal Cu-Au skarns, less common distal Zn-Pb and/or Au skarns, and, beyond the skarn front, carbonate-replacement Cu and/or Zn-Pb-Ag ± Au deposits, and/or sediment-hosted (distal-disseminated) Au deposits. Peripheral mineralization is less conspicuous in noncarbonate wall rocks but may include base metal- or Au-bearing veins and mantos. High-sulfidation epithermal deposits may occur in lithocaps above porphyry Cu deposits, where massive sulfide lodes tend to develop in deeper feeder structures and Au ± Ag-rich, disseminated deposits within the uppermost 500 m or so. Less commonly, intermediate-sulfidation epithermal mineralization, chiefly veins, may develop on the peripheries of the lithocaps. The alteration-mineralization in the porphyry Cu deposits is zoned upward from barren, early sodic-calcic through potentially ore-grade potassic, chlorite-sericite, and sericitic, to advanced argillic, the last of these constituting the lithocaps, which may attain {\textgreater}1 km in thickness if unaffected by significant erosion. Low sulfidation-state chalcopyrite ± bornite assemblages are characteristic of potassic zones, whereas higher sulfidation-state sulfides are generated progressively upward in concert with temperature decline and the concomitant greater degrees of hydrolytic alteration, culminating in pyrite ± enargite ± covellite in the shallow parts of the litho-caps. The porphyry Cu mineralization occurs in a distinctive sequence of quartz-bearing veinlets as well as in disseminated form in the altered rock between them. Magmatic-hydrothermal breccias may form during porphyry intrusion, with some of them containing high-grade mineralization because of their intrinsic permeability. In contrast, most phreatomagmatic breccias, constituting maar-diatreme systems, are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels, mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems.Porphyry Cu systems are initiated by injection of oxidized magma saturated with S- and metal-rich, aqueous fluids from cupolas on the tops of the subjacent parental plutons. The sequence of alteration-mineralization events charted above is principally a consequence of progressive rock and fluid cooling, from {\textgreater}700° to {\textless}250°C, caused by solidification of the underlying parental plutons and downward propagation of the lithostatic-hydrostatic transition. Once the plutonic magmas stagnate, the high-temperature, generally two-phase hyper-saline liquid and vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration, respectively, gives way, at {\textless}350°C, to a single-phase, low- to moderate-salinity liquid that causes the sericite-chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization. This same liquid also causes mineralization of the peripheral parts of systems, including the overlying lithocaps. The progressive thermal decline of the systems combined with synmineral paleosurface degradation results in the characteristic overprinting (telescoping) and partial to total reconstitution of older by younger alteration-mineralization types. Meteoric water is not required for formation of this alteration-mineralization sequence although its late ingress is commonplace.Many features of porphyry Cu systems at all scales need to be taken into account during planning and execution of base and precious metal exploration programs in magmatic arc settings. At the regional and district scales, the occurrence of many deposits in belts, within which clusters and alignments are prominent, is a powerful exploration concept once one or more systems are known. At the deposit scale, particularly in the porphyry Cu environment, early-formed features commonly, but by no means always, give rise to the best ore-bodies. Late-stage alteration overprints may cause partial depletion or complete removal of Cu and Au, but metal concentration may also result. Recognition of single ore deposit types, whether economic or not, in porphyry Cu systems may be directly employed in combination with alteration and metal zoning concepts to search for other related deposit types, although not all those permitted by the model are likely to be present in most systems. Erosion level is a cogent control on the deposit types that may be preserved and, by the same token, on those that may be anticipated at depth. The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle, which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more prominent alteration-mineralization.},

Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effects of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. Andradite-rich garnet is a common U-bearing mineral in a variety of alkalic igneous rocks and skarn deposits, but has been largely neglected as a U–Pb chronometer. In situ laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U–Pb dates of andradite-rich garnet from a syenite pluton and two iron skarn deposits in the North China craton demonstrate the suitability and reliability of the mineral in accurately dating magmatic and hydrothermal processes. Two hydrothermal garnets from the iron skarn deposits have homogenous cores and zoned rims (Ad 86 Gr 11 to Ad 98 Gr 1 ) with 22–118 ppm U, whereas one magmatic garnet from the syenite is texturally and compositionally homogenous (Ad 70 Gr 22 to Ad 77 Gr 14 ) and has 0.1–20 ppm U. All three garnets have flat time-resolved signals obtained from depth profile analyses for U, indicating structurally bound U. Uranium is correlated with REE in both magmatic and hydrothermal garnets, indicating that the incorporation of U into the garnet is largely controlled by substitution mechanisms. Two hydrothermal garnets yielded U–Pb dates of 129 ± 2 (2{\$}\sigma{\$}; MSWD = 0.7) and 130 ± 1 Ma (2{\$}\sigma{\$}; MSWD = 0.5), indistinguishable from zircon U–Pb dates of 131 ± 1 and 129 ± 1 Ma for their respective ore-related intrusions. The magmatic garnet has a U–Pb age of 389 ± 3 Ma (2{\$}\sigma{\$}; MSWD = 0.6), consistent with a U–Pb zircon date of 388 ± 2 Ma for the syenite. The consistency between the garnet and zircon U–Pb dates confirms the reliability and accuracy of garnet U–Pb dating. Given the occurrence of andradite-rich garnet in alkaline and ultramafic magmatic rocks and hydrothermal ore deposits, our results highlight the potential utilization of garnet as a powerful U–Pb geochronometer for dating magmatism and skarn-related mineralization.},

abstract = {The Bingham Canyon Cu-Mo-Au deposit hosts porphyry-style and skarn ores. In this study, we combine fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry with laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to constrain evolution and chemistry of the skarn-forming fluids. Alteration of impure limestones by magmatic-hydrothermal fluids, related to the emplacement of porphyry intrusions, resulted in the formation of calc-silicate mineral assemblages. The skarn-forming process includes early wollastonite and pyroxene formation (recrystallizing from Fe- poor to Fe-rich diopside) and replacement of wollastonite by several generations of garnet (grossular to andradite). The anhydrous skarn mineralization peaked by the introduction of quartz, sulfides and calcite. Pyroxene, garnet and quartz, formed during the main stage of skarn alteration preserve coeval fluid inclusions of three types: intermediate-density, brine and vapor inclusions. Identical salinities, formation temperatures and trace element content, recorded in respective fluid inclusions types in all three skarn host minerals suggest that the fluid inclusions did not undergo severe post-entrapment modification. Initial magmatic single-phase fluid of intermediate density ({\~{}}0.6 g{\textperiodcentered}cm-3, 10–20 wt. {\%} NaCleq), preserved in the deep barren center of the deposit, formed above 550 °C and 800 bar. Upon cooling and decompression below {\~{}}400 °C and {\~{}}200 bar, the fluid separated into highly saline brine (32–42 wt. {\%} NaCleq) and low-density, low-salinity vapor ({\~{}}0.2 g{\textperiodcentered}cm-3, 2–7 wt. {\%} NaCleq), both of which were entrapped in the upper parts of the deposit. These fluids predate the major sulfide mineralization in the skarns. They share similar P-T path and trace element chemistry with the fluids found in the porphyry quartz stockwork, with the notable exception of lower S and ore metal (Ag, Au, Cu and Mo) contents. Ore metal grades are, however, comparable or higher in the skarns, when compared to the porphyry lithologies. This inverse correlation indicates that sulfide precipitation in the skarns was more effective, aided by pH neutralization of the magmatic fluid, in destabilizing the metal complexes. Brittle behavior of the skarns and changes in hydrology facilitated high density veining and intense fluid-rock reaction. Powered},

abstract = {Surface mapping, core logging, and compilation of underground mine maps in the Carr Fork area have led to the definition of the stratigraphic, structural, and time-space distribution of copper, copper-lead, and lead-zinc-silver ores in the western contact aureole of the Bingham stock. The succession of alteration-mineralization stages in sedimentary rocks is defined, and each stage tentatively is correlated with stages in the evolution of alteration-mineralization in the Bingham stock.Sedimentary rocks in the contact aureole are of Pennsylvanian age and consist of quartzite with lesser amounts of calcareous carbonaceous siltstone and limestone. Compressive deformation from the southeast during Mesozoic time formed east-west trending folds and bedding plane faults across the district; differential yielding resulted in over-turning of folds in the highly deformed Carr Fork area. Following the main period of folding, stress was relieved by northward thrusting; in the Carr Fork area a set of northwest-striking imbricated thrust or right-lateral strike-slip faults formed in the upper plate of the basal Midas thrust. A system of northeast-striking faults, which were later to serve as major ore solution conduits, originated largely as tension fissures parallel to the direction of maximum principal stress. Multiple intrusions of monzonite and quartz monzonite during mid-Tertiary time were controlled to a large degree by the zone of north-east faults and by steep bedding. An Early Stage of contact metasomatism produced: diopside in quartzite and in interbedded, thin silty limestone beds; wollastonite, with minor idocrase and garnet, in thick cherty limestone; and a trace amount of sulfides. The Early Stage is related at least in part to the emplacement of the quartz monzonite of the Bingham and Last Chance stocks and continued during the initial emplacement of the quartz monzonite porphyry. Actinolite alteration of diopside in quartzite and garnetization of wollastonite-bearing marble represent the beginning of Main Stage mineralization and are time equivalent with biotite-orthoclase alteration of igneous rocks. As the stock is approached, actinolite alteration in quartzite and hornfels exhibits textural changes from bedding streaks to orbicules and to envelopes on fractures; closer to the instrusion, actinolite is altered to biotite along fractures. Traces of pyrite accompany actinolite in the outermost zones of bedding streaks and orbicules. Chalcopyrite accompanies pyrite as the fracture filling in the envelope zones. Near the stock, molybdenite veinlets have primarily biotite envelopes. Crosscutting veinlet relations indicate that the biotite zone expanded from the stock onto the outer actinolite zone during a trend toward increasing chalcopyrite: pyrite and molybdenite: Cu-Fe-sulfide ratios. Late pyritic veinlets with actinolite envelopes represent the waning of Main Stage mineralization in quartzite.Two cherty limestone beds, 15 to 60 m thick and separated by 100 m of quartzite, contain the major copper-bearing skarns in the district. Main Stage alteration in limestone consists of andradite-diopside superimposed on Early Stage wollastonite. Actinolite-diopside-garnet-epidote endoskarn occurs in quartz monzonite adjacent to garnetized limestone. In wollastonite, sulfides are chalcopyrite and bornite, with minor galena and sphalerite. Chalcopyrite: pyrite ratios increase from the outer edge of the andradite-diopside zone toward the intrusive contact, where trace amounts of bornite reappear. Chalcopyrite: pyrite ratios also increase with depth. Massive magnetite replaced garnet adjacent to the stock at lower elevations, and hematite is absent. At higher elevations, the skarns have a lower iron-oxide content, hematite appears, and the hematite: magnetite ratio increases to unity near the surface. These relations suggest an increase in oxidation and sulfidation states toward the surface and away from the stock. The Main Stage of ore deposition in limestone skarns culminated in the partial destruction of andradite and diopside. Apparent reactions include: carbonation of andradite yielding calcite and quartz with hematite, magnetite, or siderite; and combined carbonation and sulfidation, yielding pyrrhotite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite in addition to calcite and quartz. In the more diopside-rich skarn of the outer zones, alteration assemblages accompanying sulfide deposition include andradite-actinolite or actinolite in addition to the products of sulfidation and carbonation. These reactions may have been largely the result of declining temperatures; it is unclear whether any new Cu, Fe, and S was introduced at this stage.A Late Stage of alteration produced pyrite, chlorite, montmorillonite, sericite, and talc from earlier calc-silicates and locally redistributed chalcopyrite. Lead-zinc and gold deposits, accompanied by arsenic-bearing minerals such as tennantite and arseno-pyrite, also belong to this time frame. The Late Stage is believed to be contemporaneous with sericite-pyrite alteration of intrusive rocks.The following metal zones and their maximum right-angle distances from the stock contact are recognized: (1) lead-zinc-silver northeast fissure ore (Pb/Cu = 30 to 10) in nonsilicated limestone, up to 1,200 m; (2) lead-copper northeast fissure ore (Pb/Cu = 5 to 0.2) in nonsilicated limestone, up to 900 m; (3) copper ore (Pb/Cu {\textless} or = 0.02) in garnet skarn, up to 450 m. These zones do not represent a contemporaneous zonal growth pattern but rather reflect a complex history of expansion and regression of zones dependent on rock compositions, permeabilities, and the evolution of the ore fluid.},

abstract = {Igneous rocks in the Carr Fork area of Bingham Canyon belong to the multiple- intrusive Bingham stock, the Last Chance stock, and the Carr Fork dikes. The Bingham stock includes, in order of eraplacement, granite, granite porphyry, gradational granite porphyry, Type "A" porphyry, and quartz-latite porphyry. The undifferentiated Last Chance stock is an augite quartz monzonite, which is interpreted to be of the same intrusive system as the Bingham granite stock. The Carr Fork dikes are of three types that range from rhyolite porphyry to latite porphyry and correlate with porphyritic rocks of the Bingham stock. The methods of eraplacement of the igneous rocks have been interpreted. These methods include several forceful intrusions, one passive intrusion, one permissive intru- sion, and one phase of recrystallization. In the Carr Fork area hornblende and augite, with their alteration products, and magnetite and sulfide minerals are distributed zonally. They are indicators of the direction and distance to the center of the Utah Copper orebody. The alteration products of hornblende and augite, in general sequence toward the center of the orebody, are calcite, chlorite, quartz, actinolite, sericite, secondary biotite, and orthoclase. The most prominent magnetite-sulfide minerals in the same sequence are magnetite, pyrite, chal- copyrite, and bornite. Significant results of this study include the recognition of several new igneous rock types, determination of the zonal distribution of some significant alteration products, and correlation of the Last Chance stock and Carr Fork dikes with phases of the Bingham stock. Conclusions pertaining to the Carr Fork area are that (1) all the igneous rocks are the result of differentiation of one magma; (2) hornblende or augite, and magnetite were originally present in all the igneous rocks; (3) the sulfide minerals are not syn- genetic; and (4) a period of hydrothermal activity immediately followed each of the porphyritic intrusions},

abstract = {The Bingham Canyon porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposit is one of the largest and highest-grade porphyry orebodies in the world. This study focused on the northwest side of the deposit where quartz monzonite porphyry (QMP), the first and largest porphyry intrusion, hosts the bulk of the high-grade copper-gold ore (1.0{\%} Cu, 1.0 ppm Au). The north-northeast-trending, high-grade zone had pre-mining dimensions of 1,500 m strike, 300 m vertical, and 500 m width and contained more than 500 million tonnes (Mt) of ore associated with potassic alteration and abundant quartz veins. The lack of superimposed sericitic alteration yielded ideal exposures in which to study the early, high-temperature stages of ore formation, a style of mineralization that in many porphyry deposits represents the major period of copper introduction. We mapped multiple porphyry dikes in the sequence: (1) QMP, (2) latite porphyry (LP), (3) biotite porphyry (BP), (4) quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx), and (5) quartz latite porphyry (QLP). Porphyry dikes, faults, and quartz veins are steeply dipping and have two dominant orientations; north-northeast- and northweststriking. Dikes have a north-northeast strike but they thicken and develop northwest-trending apophyses and host high-grade copper-gold zones at intersections with northwest-faults, indicating that magmatic-hydrothermal fluids were focused by these structural intersections. Each porphyry intrusion was accompanied by a similar sequence of veins, potassic alteration, and sulfides. Biotite veinlets were followed by fractures with early dark micaceous (EDM) halos of sericite, K-feldspar, biotite, andalusite, and local corundum containing disseminated bornite-chalcopyrite-gold. EDM halos are cut by multiple generations of A-quartz veins representing the main Cu-Au ore-forming event. Postdating all intrusions are quartz-molybdenite veins followed by quartz-sericite-pyrite veins. Cathodoluminescence (CL) petrography identified distinct A-quartz veinlets consisting of dark-luminescing quartz filling fractures and dissolution vugs in earlier A-quartz veins and adjacent porphyry wall rock. These veinlets contain abundant bornite and chalcopyrite and minor K-feldspar and are closely linked in time to the introduction of the bulk of the copper and gold. Although a similar sequence of veins was repeated on emplacement of all porphyry intrusions, the vein density and intensity of potassic alteration declined with time. The youngest porphyry, QLP, is mostly weakly mineralized and locally unaltered. These observations indicate that magmatic-hydrothermal fluids underwent a similar physiochemical evolution during and immediately following emplacement of each of several porphyry dikes. The relationship between EDM veins and A-quartz veins requires that the flux of magmatic fluid from the magma chamber occurred in an episodic manner as opposed to a continuous discharge. Vein truncation relationships coupled with abrupt changes in copper-gold grades, sulfide ratios, and potassic alteration intensity at porphyry intrusive contacts indicate that the mass of introduced copper and gold decreased significantly during successive porphyry intrusive-hydrothermal cycles, presumably due to depletion of metals and volatiles in the underlying magma chamber. 2010 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.},

abstract = {This report describes the general geology of the Bingham mine and presents a 1:9,600 scale detailed mine geology map. Important new contributions shown on this map include (1) a prealteration monzonitic classification of igneous rock, (2) the Ohio Copper dike in Copper Notch, (3) the Alice W. dike extending into the porphyry phases in Carr Fork, (4) reinterpretation of gradational granite porphyry as a zone of hybridization around quartz monzonite porphyry, surrounded by a zone of recrystallization, (5) more detailed mapping of small calcareous sandstone and limestone beds, and (6) the delineation of subsidiary folds related to the Bingham syncline.Six major igneous phases of the Bingham stock intrude folded sedimentary rocks of the Butterfield Peaks and Bingham Mine formations. The folding, along with left-lateral, northeast tear faults, accompanied thrusting. Early equigranular phases are quartz poor compared to the later porphyry phases; both are intermediate in composition. Stocks are emplaced mainly into the Apex fold which is interpreted as a second-order fold on the southwest limb of the Bingham syncline. Hydrothermal alteration and mineralization is genetically related to the quartz monzonite porphyry, the major porphyry phase, based on zone patterns around the top of the intrusion. Later, normal, northwest faulting cut the intrusions and is related to Basin and Range tectonics.},

abstract = {Skarns are one of the few direct genetic links between magma and base metals in ore deposits, yet temporal relationships between skarns and their assumed causative plutons are rarely confirmed with radiometric formation ages. Skarns have been notoriously difficult to date directly due to a limited primary mineral assemblage, generally garnet and pyroxene. Discrepancies in timescales of skarn formation versus pluton emplacement emphasize our tenuous understanding of temporal relationships between plutons and hydrothermal systems including the duration of hydrothermal activity and skarn mineral growth rates. Here we apply a new method for U–Pb dating grossular-andradite (grandite) garnet via LA-ICP-MS and present the first comprehensive study to focus on U–Pb dates of primary skarn garnet. We present U–Pb age constraints on garnets from multiple skarns within the Jurassic and Cretaceous arcs of the North American Cordillera. Two case studies (Darwin and Empire Mountain skarns) illustrate the effectiveness of the U–Pb grandite method by demonstrating that garnet U–Pb ages agree within error of the pluton- and skarn-hosted U–Pb zircon ages. Two additional study localities (Black Rock and Mojave skarns) demonstrate the ability of grandite U–Pb ages to: 1) directly identify a causative igneous event, and 2) record timing of major tectonic events, specifically extensional to trans-tensional shifts in the Jurassic Mojave of California.},
