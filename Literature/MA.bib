abstract = {This report describes the general geology of the Bingham mine and presents a 1:9,600 scale detailed mine geology map. Important new contributions shown on this map include (1) a prealteration monzonitic classification of igneous rock, (2) the Ohio Copper dike in Copper Notch, (3) the Alice W. dike extending into the porphyry phases in Carr Fork, (4) reinterpretation of gradational granite porphyry as a zone of hybridization around quartz monzonite porphyry, surrounded by a zone of recrystallization, (5) more detailed mapping of small calcareous sandstone and limestone beds, and (6) the delineation of subsidiary folds related to the Bingham syncline.Six major igneous phases of the Bingham stock intrude folded sedimentary rocks of the Butterfield Peaks and Bingham Mine formations. The folding, along with left-lateral, northeast tear faults, accompanied thrusting. Early equigranular phases are quartz poor compared to the later porphyry phases; both are intermediate in composition. Stocks are emplaced mainly into the Apex fold which is interpreted as a second-order fold on the southwest limb of the Bingham syncline. Hydrothermal alteration and mineralization is genetically related to the quartz monzonite porphyry, the major porphyry phase, based on zone patterns around the top of the intrusion. Later, normal, northwest faulting cut the intrusions and is related to Basin and Range tectonics.},

abstract = {Skarns are one of the few direct genetic links between magma and base metals in ore deposits, yet temporal relationships between skarns and their assumed causative plutons are rarely confirmed with radiometric formation ages. Skarns have been notoriously difficult to date directly due to a limited primary mineral assemblage, generally garnet and pyroxene. Discrepancies in timescales of skarn formation versus pluton emplacement emphasize our tenuous understanding of temporal relationships between plutons and hydrothermal systems including the duration of hydrothermal activity and skarn mineral growth rates. Here we apply a new method for U–Pb dating grossular-andradite (grandite) garnet via LA-ICP-MS and present the first comprehensive study to focus on U–Pb dates of primary skarn garnet. We present U–Pb age constraints on garnets from multiple skarns within the Jurassic and Cretaceous arcs of the North American Cordillera. Two case studies (Darwin and Empire Mountain skarns) illustrate the effectiveness of the U–Pb grandite method by demonstrating that garnet U–Pb ages agree within error of the pluton- and skarn-hosted U–Pb zircon ages. Two additional study localities (Black Rock and Mojave skarns) demonstrate the ability of grandite U–Pb ages to: 1) directly identify a causative igneous event, and 2) record timing of major tectonic events, specifically extensional to trans-tensional shifts in the Jurassic Mojave of California.},

@article{Deng2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. Andradite-rich garnet is a common U-bearing mineral in a variety of alkalic igneous rocks and skarn deposits, but has been largely neglected as a U–Pb chronometer. In situ laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U–Pb dates of andradite-rich garnet from a syenite pluton and two iron skarn deposits in the North China craton demonstrate the suitability and reliability of the mineral in accurately dating magmatic and hydrothermal processes. Two hydrothermal garnets from the iron skarn deposits have homogenous cores and zoned rims (Ad 86 Gr 11 to Ad 98 Gr 1 ) with 22–118 ppm U, whereas one magmatic garnet from the syenite is texturally and compositionally homogenous (Ad 70 Gr 22 to Ad 77 Gr 14 ) and has 0.1–20 ppm U. All three garnets have flat time-resolved signals obtained from depth profile analyses for U, indicating structurally bound U. Uranium is correlated with REE in both magmatic and hydrothermal garnets, indicating that the incorporation of U into the garnet is largely controlled by substitution mechanisms. Two hydrothermal garnets yielded U–Pb dates of 129 ± 2 (2$\sigma$; MSWD = 0.7) and 130 ± 1 Ma (2$\sigma$; MSWD = 0.5), indistinguishable from zircon U–Pb dates of 131 ± 1 and 129 ± 1 Ma for their respective ore-related intrusions. The magmatic garnet has a U–Pb age of 389 ± 3 Ma (2$\sigma$; MSWD = 0.6), consistent with a U–Pb zircon date of 388 ± 2 Ma for the syenite. The consistency between the garnet and zircon U–Pb dates confirms the reliability and accuracy of garnet U–Pb dating. Given the occurrence of andradite-rich garnet in alkaline and ultramafic magmatic rocks and hydrothermal ore deposits, our results highlight the potential utilization of garnet as a powerful U–Pb geochronometer for dating magmatism and skarn-related mineralization.},

abstract = {This study presents a new laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) based U-Pb geochronometric method for dating grossular-andradite (grandite) garnet. Grandite is a primary skarn mineral, therefore dating its growth directly dates hydrothermal activity. As zircon U-Pb geochronometry provides a high-resolution record of magmatic processes, grandite U-Pb dating has the potential to provide a complementary record for hydrothermal systems. This study characterizes four garnets of variable grossular-andradite content and age as potential reference materials for LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronology: Willsboro Andradite ({\~{}} 1020 Ma, Adirondacks, USA), Red and Yellow Mali Grandite ({\~{}} 200 Ma, Southern Mali) and Lake Jaco Grossular ({\~{}} 35 Ma, Coahuila, Mexico). Isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) U-Pb analyses of Willsboro andradite yield a mean206Pb/238U date of 1022 ± 16 Ma. We use Willsboro Andradite as a primary reference material for LA-ICPMS U-Pb characterization of the two other garnets. The non-radiogenic Pb (Pbc) concentration in grandite is variable between specimens. Willsboro Andradite and Mali Grandites contain almost purely radiogenic Pb (Pb*), however Lake Jaco Grossular has a higher Pbc concentration comparatively and yields discordant U/Pb ratios. For specimens with highly variable Pb*/Pbc, linear regression is employed to derive a lower-intercept age. LA-ICPMS U-Pb dates for Yellow Mali Grandite (202 ± 2 Ma;206Pb/238U weighted mean) and Lake Jaco Grossular (35 ± 2 Ma; lower intercept) agree with independent ID-TIMS U-Pb (202.0 ± 1.2 Ma) and (U-Th)/He dates (35 ± 5 Ma) derived for each specimen. The precision of LA-ICPMS U-Pb dates varies between 1–10{\%} (2$\sigma$) for the analyzed garnets. Considering the short estimated lifespans of pluton-related hydrothermal systems (tens of thousands to a few million years), Neogene skarns present the best opportunity to test for and resolve separate episodes of garnet growth at these precision levels. As a performance test for the method, we present new U-Pb andradite data from a Late Miocene skarn system on Serifos Island, Greece. This garnet yields a lower-intercept age of 9.15 ± 0.36 Ma, in agreement with biotite Rb-Sr and zircon U-Pb dates from the causative pluton.},
